Driven to this, the pairs of lovers roll  
into the parking lot like shaken dice,  
and though  they've come expressly for a vista  
much grander than themselves, begin to fuse  
into the other's eyes.  Oh, that fond conviction  
of a match made in Heaven!  
Below them, at the base  
of an ancient hill, the million lamps of Rome  
light up in rosy approbation, each  
signalling to one chosen counterpart  
among the stars the nightly freshened wish  
to lie uniquely in its dazzled gaze.
